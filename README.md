# Email-Spam-Classifier

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project on Email Spam Classification using the Spam Assassin dataset.

<h3>Description<h/3>

This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for a project focused on Email Spam Classification using the Spam Assisn dataset. The dataset, available on Kaggle at the following link: Spam Assisn Email Dataset, consists of 6046 e-mails, including 4150 ham (non-spam) and 1896 spam messages. Each e-mail in the dataset is labeled accordingly.

The project's objective is to develop a robust system for accurately classifying e-mails as either ham or spam. The repository provides the necessary code and accompanying resources to train and evaluate machine learning models specifically designed for email spam classification. These models leverage the contents of the e-mails to make reliable predictions.

By utilizing this repository, researchers and developers can explore and experiment with various techniques to enhance email spam detection and contribute to the advancement of email security.
